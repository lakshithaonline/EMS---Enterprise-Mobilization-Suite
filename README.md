## Features

### Attendance Management and Monitoring

The EMS Application enables the management and monitoring of employee attendance. This feature allows administrators to track the time when employees clock in and out. Additionally, the system can generate reports to show the attendance of each employee, the total number of hours worked, and the percentage of attendance.

### Leave Management and Monitoring

The Leave Management and Monitoring feature of the EMS Application allows employees to apply for leave and administrators to manage and monitor leave applications. This feature also generates reports to show the number of days an employee has taken off, the type of leave taken, and the remaining leave days.

### Employee Management and Monitoring

The Employee Management and Monitoring feature of the EMS Application enables the management of employee records. Administrators can add new employees, update existing records, and monitor employee information such as personal details, contact information, and job details.

## Access Controls

The EMS Application has two levels of access control:

- **Superadmin:** The Superadmin controls all aspects of the EMS Application, including the ability to add and remove administrators, and monitor and track all employee data.
- **Admin:** The Admin controls the main features of the EMS Application, including attendance management and monitoring, leave management and monitoring, and employee management and monitoring.
